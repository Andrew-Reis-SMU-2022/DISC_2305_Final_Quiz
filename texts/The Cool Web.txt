But we have speech, to chill the angry day, 
And speech, to dull the rose’s cruel scent. 
We spell away the overhanging night, 
We spell away the soldiers and the fright.@
But if we let our tongues lose self-possession, 
Throwing off language and its watery clasp 
Before our death, instead of when death comes, 
Facing the wide glare of the children’s day, 
Facing the rose, the dark sky and the drums, 
We shall go mad no doubt and die that way.

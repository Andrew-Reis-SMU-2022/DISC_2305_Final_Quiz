No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be; Am an attendant lord, one that will do To swell a progress, start a scene or two, Advise the prince; no doubt, and easy tool, Deferential, glad to be of use, Politic, cautious, and meticulous; Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse; At times, indeed, almost ridiculous—Almost, at times, the Fool.@
And I have known the eyes already, known them all—The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase, And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin, When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall, Then how should I begin To spit out out all the butt-ends of my days and ways? And how should I presume? And I have known the arms already, known them all—Arms that are braceleted and white and bare (But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hiar!) Is it perfume from a dress That makes me so digress? Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl. And should I then presume? And how should I begin?@
In the room the women come and go Talking of Michelangelo. And indeed there will be time To wonder, ‘Do I dare?’ and, ‘Do I dare?’ Time to turn back and descend the stair, With a bald spot in the middle of my hair—(They will say: ‘How his hair is growing then!’) My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin, My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin—(They will say: ‘But how his arms and legs are thin!’) Do I dare Disturb the universe? In a minute there is time For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.

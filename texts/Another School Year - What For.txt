	“But having finished the day’s work, what do you do with those other eight hours – with the other third of your life? Let’s say you go home to your family. What sort of family will you be raising?

	I am here to tell you that the business of college is not only to train you, but to put you in touch with what the best human minds have thought. If you have no time for Shakespeare, for a basic look at philosophy, for the continuity of the fine arts, for that lesson of man’s development we call history – then you have no business being in college.

	Assume, for example, that you want to be a physicist. You pass the great stone halls of, say, M.I.T., and there cut into the stone are the names of the scientists. The chances are that few if any of you will leave your names to be cut into those stones. Yet any of you who managed to stay awake through part of a high school course in physics knows more about physics than did many of those great makes of the past. You know more because they left you what they knew. The first course in any science is essentially a history course.
